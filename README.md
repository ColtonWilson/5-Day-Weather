5-Day Weather  Forcast


## Description

This 5-day weather forcast will be connected to to a weather api. 
<br>Located at: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}
<br>This website will show the weather for multiple cities. 
<br>Currently there is an issue with the second call to API and it is not getting the five days. Need to continue work to fix.
